# WordMapper

  Language and its history is a fascinating thing, and the words we use every day come from all over the world! WordMapper is a full-stack educational (or time wasterðŸ™ƒ) app that allows the grammatically curious to explore the history of the English language on a map!

   Built using a React frontend and [Rails backend](https://github.com/seanpadden/wordmapper-backend), it leverages the [Webster Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/) and Google Maps to pinpoint the approximate location of a word's origin coordinates, based on the earliest known homeland of a language. 
   
   There is still a **lot** more I'd like to add to this project, including adding more languages and coordinates to the API as well as a more fleshed out travel history for users, but it's a fun start!
